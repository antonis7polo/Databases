### Disclaimers
- Because of the aims of this project and the limited time for its completion in regards to its requirements, less focus was given to the visual aesthetics of the UI and more to the functionality of the Database and its connection to the website.
- All data was randomly generated by the Faker python library and any correlation to real world names, phone numbers, etc. is purely coincidental.
- The app was designed using MacOS, minor updates may be needed for different operating systems.
